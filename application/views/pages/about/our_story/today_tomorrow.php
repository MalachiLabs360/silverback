                <p class="iq-font-15">Today, Silverback Learning Solutions and the Mileposts student achievement solution (StAS) has entered into national distribution partnerships with the Association of Educational Service Agencies (AESA) as well as many statewide chapters of AESA. Mileposts has already been adopted in school districts across 19 states with outstanding performance results. A passionate teacher user group of thousands is providing continuous collaboration and feedback in the tireless pursuit to make Mileposts even better.</p>
                <p class="iq-font-15">The Silverback/Mileposts technology has always been cloud-based, helping to lower costs and rapidly becoming an online gateway to teachers, parents, and students in order to collaborate and communicate more effectively. Teachers are able to create personalized assignments and interventions, monitor achievement and gain real-time insights to improve the quality of customized instruction for group, sub-group or individual students that flows with their daily routine in the classroom. We have entered into strategic partnerships with companies such as Gooru, the leading educational search engine with over 14 million resources fully-indexed to state standards, which has also been fully integrated into the Mileposts software user experience because teachers expressed a need for it there. We support a growing nation of talented and passionate teachers who are embracing the modernization of education in America, and we continue our pursuit of maximizing the impact education has for every child in their pursuit of their American dream. Together, anything is possible.</p>
