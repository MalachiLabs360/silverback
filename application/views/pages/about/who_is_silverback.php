We have one purpose – to deliver solutions focused on increasing individual student achievement.  Silverback’s flagship product, Mileposts, helps users create and connect individualized learning plans and interventions to all of the instructional and assessment resources already available in schools, and to the millions of Open Educational Resources available on the web.</p>
