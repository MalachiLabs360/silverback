                <p class="iq-font-15">In 2004, after 2 years of research and refinement by the Mileposts committee, the Blaine County School District implemented the Mileposts Program and provided educator training at each school. This was a significant milestone because a new teaching system, built by the teachers themselves was now enabling them to easily personalize education for each and every student in their classrooms. The initial response was overwhelmingly positive and supportive by administrators, teachers, students and parents. Over the next few school years, evaluations and a wealth of teacher feedback dramatically accelerated refinements to the Mileposts Program and new features into the Mileposts software. The Mileposts Program had become an intuitive and seamless part of everyday life for teachers, helping them to impact individual student learning at the point of instruction and actually helping to make their jobs better and easier in the process. As positive results continued to build dramatically year after year, other school districts in the southern Idaho region expressed interest to participate. By the spring of 2007, The Mileposts Program was rolled out to 6 area school districts with many receiving state and national awards for achievement by 2009-10. And as more teachers are trained and use the program across the country, the feedback loop to improve the solution and features of the software continues to grow. The results are humbling and inspiring.</p>
                <p class="iq-font-15">Teachers are teaching us and the teaching community at large how to personalize education for every student, and actually embrace the use of technology to help make their jobs easier and more rewarding.</p>
