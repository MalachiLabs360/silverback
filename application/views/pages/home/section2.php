                    <p class="iq-font-15">It’s uncanny how many “big ideas” that have changed the world, started in the humble confines of a garage or a college dorm room. For Dr. Lewis, and the Mileposts advisory committee of talented educators he enlisted in 2002, the start-up environment was not the dorm room or a garage but rather the classroom. Together, if they were going to re-imagine and map out how teachers could teach more effectively, it would require that they documented teacher and classroom frustrations, daily workflow, and how to add the right combination of new processes and technology to improve the process, and try it out. Over the next few years of real classroom observations, the Mileposts advisory committee brainstormed and began developing a complete modern educational system that would leverage all of the existing resource investments and align them with a complementary set of prevention, intervention, and corrective retention strategies that were focused on creating the richest personalized learning environment possible for every student.</p>
                    <p class="iq-font-15">Technology would be applied to fill identified gaps and create a dynamic student achievement system, which stores student profile information, files assessment data (both state and district), monitors student benchmark progress, as well as records documentation of accommodations, interventions and plans of all students during their school career. Together a complete system and teaching approach is capable of easily documenting all elements of the process and progress, and creates the ability for teachers, students, administrators, and parents to collaborate and share in 360° accountability. The 360° equation requires all stakeholders to sign an Accountability Agreement every 3 years and also includes the following hinge points.</p>
