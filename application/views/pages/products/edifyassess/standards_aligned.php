                <p class="iq-font-15">EdifyAssess is centered around state standards including the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). All aspects of the platform (including assessment items, reports, remediation resources) are aligned to the standard that your organization uses, including CCSS. EdifyAssess comes with two large, high-quality item banks that are available to our clients as part of the EdifyAssess platform at no additional cost. In addition, you can create your own item bank by importing or authoring new items. We also offer assessment sets that are patterned after various state exams. Finally, you can now also purchase ReadiBank with EdifyAssess.</p>
