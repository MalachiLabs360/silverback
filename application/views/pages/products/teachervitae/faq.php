                            A: Meta tagging allows evaluators and evaluates to correlate and communicate information via an organized system of labels (aka “tags”). Administrators use tags to tie every observation and note to the state and/or district summative evaluation for easy recall and meaningful conversations throughout the year. Educators can share tagged documents with evaluators and other colleagues. This makes it easy for employees to self-identify evidence they feel is emblematic of the professional standards deemed important by the district and/or state. Information needed to effectively complete the summative evaluation is at the fingertips of the evaluator.
